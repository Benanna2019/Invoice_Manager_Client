//Home page
//I want to have a user side bar
//I want the page to be laid out with a lot of different components on it
//Top row will be small boxes with different graphical information(potentially)

//Main middle section will be a table with all invoices
//Have a table for 'Jobs' that user has done and the invoice# connected to it
import React from "react";

export default function Home({ signedIn, setSignedIn }) {
  //state for userinvoices
  //state for currentuser
  //state for S3 stuff

  //useEffect for
  // - user
  // - invoices
  // - table to display invoices in that format
  // - data for stats cards at top
  // - --(might need to be seperate components for each card since it is different data)

  return <div>//Stats cards //side navbar //Map over DisplayInvoices</div>;
}
